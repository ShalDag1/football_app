# Football app for friends



We are 25-35 friends who play footbal weekly , i want to build an app that everyplayer will use , the app need to be only for our fields.

here i will share the required features i want to be on the app:

## 1. User profile

  every user will need to register , with username and password(no strong password needed) and he will have is own profile(firstname, lastname, age, preferred role) .
  the profile include some details , like name , preferred role , age ...
  as well every player will have a statistics based on the games he have played ( sum of goals , sum of winnings - thats all, sum of being the top scorer ) 
  the statiscs will be based on the admin that will submit them
  1. every week each player assign to a team , a player can score goals and win the cup
  2. every player have statistics of how much goals he scored , and how much cups he won
  3. 

 

## 2. Admin profile
  1. admin is a user with same details as normal user((firstname, lastname, age, preferred role) and statistics, as well he have some privvileged
  2. admin can upload statistics of games , the statiscs are all goals and winnings
  3. admin can add users
  4. admin 


# 3. statistics page

  1. only admin can add statistics of players.
  2. every user can see all players statiscs , and there is a table that can be sorted by goals or winnings(i.e who scored the most and who have most wins for) and also we can filter it by dates
  3. the statistics is the main feature here , it will help team leaders to choose players based on statistics(which i said for now it only goals and winning cups)


# 4. random

this feature is to help the team leaders to know who choose first , second and third. any user can go into the random page , they can choose 3 users(or more, or less) or ulpoad custon name , and the app will make a random who of those. it will rank them from 1...n
